Kronos - SimplyBlogg
====================

This is a MVC with a prepared theme simplyBlogg that you can use to set up your own blog site in just a few minutes by

git clone https://github.com/matsbeddinge/kronos.git

2. Make the application/data directory writeable with following command, (standing in the directory where you downloaded the MVC):
cd kronos; chmod 777 application/data (or use an ftp program like filezilla)

3. If your installation is not on the root of the server you have to edit the .htaccess file. Open the file in a texteditor and
uncomment the line RewriteBase and write the relative path for your installation, by example: RewriteBase /~mpsv11/phpmvc/kmom10/
